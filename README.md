# Learning Arena

This repository contains various machine learning algorithms I'm using along my PhD.

## ToDo List
- Vector-Valued kernels
- Various kernels
- Gaussian mixture (seds as example)
- Support vector
- Fix color distribution for manifold learning
- K-means
- Added mean function to GP

## Under testing
- User defined objective (constranint) for GP optimization
